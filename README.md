- 👋 Hi, I’m @PaulBalto
- 👀 I’m interested in everything really. Computer's have become a new fun hobby for me, nice to go and do maths again as I'm years out of school now.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, doing a course to be an IT specialist in it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing yet, happy to just figure things out in my spare time for now.
- 📫 How to reach me ... paulcullen96@yahoo.ie
